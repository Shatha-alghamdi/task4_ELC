# task4_ELC
# Introduction:
Designing the robot's mouth using the LED Matrix
# Execution platform:
-Wokwi programming and simulation site

-Led matrix generator site
# Requirements:
-Arduino

-Dot matrix screen

# Implementation steps:
First, we connect the screen to the Arduino by connecting the V5 port on the Arduino to the V+ port on the screen

and connect the GND port to the GND port

and connect the DIN port to port 12

and connect the CS port to port 11

and connect the CLK port to port 10

After the connection, we design the mouth on the Led matrix generator site and program it with the codes so that we can display the design on the screen.
